# Cisco Network Services Orchestrator (NSO) New Sandbox
Cisco DevNet added a new NSO sandbox directly to DevNet, which is easier
to use than the dCloud version. This demo is an update to the course
demonstrating that new NSO sandbox.

Also newly added are the NSO Swagger-style API docs:
`https://developer.cisco.com/docs/nso/#!cisco-nso-swagger-api-docs`

The following reference files are included in `data_ref/`:
  * `arp_stats.csv`: Script output file example containing all ARP entries
  * `dist-rtr01-arp.json`: ARP entries present on first router
  * `dist-rtr01-full.json`: ARP entries present on second router
  * `dist-rtr02-arp.json`: Full device config/stats for first router
  * `dist-rtr02-full.json`: Full device config/stats for second router
